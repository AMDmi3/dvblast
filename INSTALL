Installing DVBlast
==================

No autotools yet... You have to tweak the Makefile by hand, especially
if your kernel is S2API-enabled but not your distribution (indicate the
path of your kernel where appropriate). Compile the program with `make`
and install with `make install`.

DVBlast no longer requires libdvbpsi runtime and libdvbpsi-devel for
compilation. Instead you must install biTStream on your build machine
(no runtime library needed). biTStream is currently available via SVN at:
svn://svn.videolan.org/bitstream/trunk
