Welcome to DVBlast!

DVBlast is a simple and powerful streaming application based on the
linux-dvb API. It opens a DVB device, tunes it, places PID filters,
configures a CAM module, and demultiplexes the packets to several RTP
outputs. It supports the new S2API of linux-dvb (compile option).

DVBlast also supports Computer Modules DVB-ASI input cards and UDP/RTP
input and pass-through.

Output to UDP rather than RTP is also supported so those IPTV set top
boxes that don't do RTP over multicast can also use the streams.  
This functionality is not recommended and should only be used if
absolutely necessary.

Pass-through of now/next and schedule data (EIT tables) is supported
(via -e option), this data is filtered to only contain the tables for
the service being sent, and only works when using SIDs to specify the
channel in the configuration file.

The configuration file for outputs can be reloaded without losing
a single packet. MMI operation and monitoring are provided with an
external control program using a Unix domain socket.

DVBlast is very lightweight and designed to operate in tight
environments. Its memory and CPU usages are kept to a minimum, and it
features only one thread of execution. It has very few dependencies
(libdvbpsi and libc). We intend to keep it that way.

Detailed documentation is available in the INSTALL file.
