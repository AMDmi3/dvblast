Installing DVBlast
==================

No autotools yet... You have to tweak the Makefile by hand, especially
if your kernel is S2API-enabled but not your distribution (indicate the
path of your kernel where appropriate). Compile the program with `make`.


Tuning DVBlast
==============

You usually want to supply DVBlast with the parameters of a transponder,
for instance for DVB-S :

dvblast -f 11570000 -s 27500000 -v 18

This tunes to frequency 11570 MHz, symbol rate 27500, horizontal (-v 18). For
DVB-S2, you must indicate a modulation with -m qpsk or -m psk_8. For DVB-T,
a bandwidth (usually -b 8 for 8 MHz multiplexes).

Other rarely used options are available - run dvblast -h for more
information.


Configuring outputs
===================

DVBlast reads a configuration file containing one or several lines in the
format :
<IP>[:<port>][/udp]	<always on>	<SID>	[<PID>,]*

For instance :
239.255.0.1:1234	1	10750	1234,1235,1236

The configuration file can be reloaded by sending "HUP" to the program, or
via the dvblastctl program.

The "always on" flag tells DVBlast whether the channel is expected to
be on at all times or if it may break. If set to "1", then DVBlast will
regularly reset the CAM module if it fails to descramble the service,
assuming the module is dead. Every time it is reset a few TS packets
will be lost, that is why this feature is optional.

There are three ways of configuring the PIDs to stream :

1. SID-based

239.255.0.1:1234	1	10750	

DVBlast will stream all known PIDs from service 10750 (video, audio, and
subtitles). The resulting stream is fully MPEG-compliant, with PAT and PMT.

2. SID and PIDs

239.255.0.1:1234	1	10750	1234,1235

DVBlast will stream SID 10750, but only PID 1234 and 1235 will be output.
Other known PIDs will be discarded and removed from the PMT. The list of
PIDs in the config file does not include the PAT and PMT, but it must
include the PCR PID if it is different from the video or audio PID, otherwise
the stream won't be compliant.

3. PIDs only

239.255.0.1:1234	1	0	0,128,1234,1235

DVBlast will only stream the PIDs passed. No PAT and PMT will be generated,
so if they are not included the stream won't be compliant. Also the
included PAT and PMT may contain ghost programs or ESes.

Note that the CAM will not be programmed in that case (unless it has
been programmed by another line of the config file). The file is read
from the command-line :

dvblast -c /tmp/dvblast.conf


Monitoring
==========

If dvblast is run with the -r option, the dvblastctl program can be used
to retrieve information from DVBlast about the front-end or CAM module.

dvblastctl -r /tmp/dvblast.sock fe_status
dvblastctl -r /tmp/dvblast.sock mmi_status
dvblastctl -r /tmp/dvblast.sock shutdown


CAM menu
========

For easier access to the CAM menus, the dvblast_mmi.sh shell script is
provided :

dvblast_mmi.sh -r /tmp/dvblast.sock


Advanced features
=================

DVBlast may handle several DVB adapters in the same machine with the -a switch.

For better latency, run DVBlast in real-time priority (-i 1).

DVBlast can also stream the entire transponder to an address :
dvblast -u -d 172.16.42.42:1235 -f 11570000 -s 27500000 -v 18

The -u switch disables the PID filters, so that all PIDs, even the
unused ones, can be output. With -e, dvblast also streams EIT and SDT packets
for the related services.

By default DVBlast outputs RTP streams; if you want to disable the RTP
header, you can either use the -U switch, or append "/udp" to the IP:port
string of the configuration file.

Other options are self-understandable, and are listed in dvblast -h.
