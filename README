Welcome to DVBlast !

DVBlast is a simple and powerful streaming application based on the
linux-dvb API. It opens a DVB device, tunes it, places PID filters,
configures a CAM module, and demultiplexes the packets to several RTP
outputs. The configuration file for RTP outputs can be reloaded without
losing a single packet. All of this with a minimal memory and CPU
footprint. It has very few dependancies (libdvbpsi and libc). It also
supports the new S2API of linux-dvb.
