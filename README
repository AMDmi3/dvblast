Welcome to DVBlast !

DVBlast is a simple and powerful streaming application based on the
linux-dvb API. It opens a DVB device, tunes it, places PID filters,
configures a CAM module, and demultiplexes the packets to several RTP
outputs. It supports the new S2API of linux-dvb (compile option).

The configuration file for RTP outputs can be reloaded without losing
a single packet. MMI operation and monitoring are provided with an
external control program using a UINIX socket.

DVBlast is very lightweight and designed to operate in tight
environment. Its memory and CPU uses are kept to a minimal, and it
features only one thread of execution. It has very few dependancies
(libdvbpsi and libc). I intend to keep it that way.
