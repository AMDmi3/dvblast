Installing DVBlast
==================

Compile the program with `make` and install with `make install`. Your
kernel must support DVB S2API which was merged in Linux 2.6.28 and released
on 24 Dec 2008.

DVBlast 2.0 no longer requires libdvbpsi runtime and libdvbpsi-devel for
compilation. Instead you must install biTStream on your build machine (no
runtime library is needed).

To install biTStream, clone git repository and run `make install`.

    git clone git://git.videolan.org/bitstream.git
    cd bitstream
    make install
